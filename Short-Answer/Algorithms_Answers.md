Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Exercise I

a) O(n) -> Logarithmic. The while loop will determine how many times n will be multiplied.
b) O(n^3) -> Linear. The number of for loop nested will determine the exponential of n.
c) O(n) -> Linear. This is a constant statement.

Exercise II
a)RUntime: O(n)
```
building = n floorOfBuilding = f
for f in range(len(n) - 1):
    if f > floorBroken: 
        egg = broken

```
